<p dir="ltr"><span>hostelbasera.com at its core is a website of students for students. Our aim is to help students find, book and enjoy the best places to stay, and property owners (hereinafter referred to as&nbsp;hosts) to showcase their properties to get easily discovered in the right way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are focused on building a reality where individuals from every background feel welcome and respected, regardless of how far they have come from home and to ensure&nbsp;equality to&nbsp;every individual by&nbsp;warrant against all&nbsp;forms of social discrimination. We embrace diversity and respect the personal dignity of our fellow guests.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>HostelBasera.com respects the personal dignity, privacy and personal rights of every guest and is committed to maintaining an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Therefore, hosts must not discriminate on the basis of origin, nationality, religion, race, gender, age or sexual orientation, or engage in any kind of verbal or physical harassment based on any of the above or any other reason.</span></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Refuse to provide reasonable accommodations, including flexibility when guests with disabilities request modest changes in your house rules, such as bringing an assistant that is necessary because of the disability or using an available parking space near the unit. When a guest requests such an accommodation, the host and the guest should engage in a dialogue to explore mutually agreeable ways to ensure the unit meets the guest&rsquo;s needs.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Hosts&nbsp;may:</span></p>
</li>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Nothing in this policy prevents a host from turning down a guest on the basis of a characteristic that is not protected under the civil rights laws or closely associated with a protected class. For example, a host may turn down a guest who wants to smoke and/or drink in a unit or place limits on the number of guests in a unit.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When guests are turned down.&nbsp;Hosts should keep in mind that no one likes to be turned down. While a host may have, and articulate, lawful and legitimate reasons for turning down a potential guest, it may cause that member of our community to feel unwelcome or excluded. Hosts should make every effort to be welcoming to guests of all backgrounds. Hosts who demonstrate a pattern of rejecting guests from a protected class (even while articulating legitimate reasons) undermine the strength of our community by making potential guests feel unwelcome and HostelBasera.com may suspend hosts who have demonstrated such a pattern from the website.</span></p> </span><br><br>
