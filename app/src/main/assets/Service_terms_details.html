When you create an Advertisement, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Property, including requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to rent your Property. Any Member wishing to rent Properties included in Advertisements with such requirements must meet these requirements. We do not guarantee that any Member claiming to meet any requirements in fact does so and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether or not a Member does meet your requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the &ldquo;Hosts&rdquo; section of the Services.</span></p>
